## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
```bash

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-teacher.git
cd virtual-teacher

### **2️⃣ Set Up Database**

Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed.
Create a database called virtual_teacher_db.
Update application.properties with your database credentials:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:8080/virtual_teacher_db
spring.datasource.username=your_db_user
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password

3️⃣ Run the Application
Using Maven Wrapper:
mvn spring-boot:run

4️⃣ API Testing with Postman
You can use Postman or cURL to test API endpoints.

Example: Register a New User

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username": "student123", "password": "password", "role": "STUDENT"}'
